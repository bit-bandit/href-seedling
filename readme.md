# href-seedling
`href-seedling` is a minimalist way of organizing your profiles on social media.

## Usage
Edit `input.md`, and `style.css`. It should be laid out in a fairly easy to modify way.
Run `main.ts`, and it should output an HTML file, aptly named `output.html`. That's it.

## Sample Screenshot

This is the default look of an `href-seedling` page, with no modifications made to the 
default stylesheet, or Markdown template.
